# django-graphql-react-docker

I based this project off of [this repo](https://github.com/ZoeLiao/Django-GraphQL-React-Demo). I dockerized the containers and added docker-compose to make it easier to run locally. 

The purpose of this repo is to learn more about devops (Docker, K8s, Nginx, CI/CD pipelines, etc).

# To Run:
`docker-compose up`
