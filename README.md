# django-graphql-react-docker

This is a multi-container application (Django graphql API + react client, served with nginx)

I based this project off of [this repo](https://github.com/ZoeLiao/Django-GraphQL-React-Demo). I dockerized the containers and added docker-compose to make it easier to run locally. 

The purpose of this repo is to learn more about devops (Docker, K8s, Nginx, CI/CD pipelines, etc).

# To Run:
1. `docker-compose up`
1. Navigate in browser to `localhost:8080`
